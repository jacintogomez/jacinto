<h2>Teaching Assistant: NYU Tandon School of Engineering</h2>
<p>
    I am currently a TA for the Tandon Bridge Computer Science Program 24 and 17 week cohorts. I conduct weekly office
    hours, host review sessions for exams, and assist with grading of homework assignments and exams. The combined cohorts
    have about 200 students total, and topics taught in
    this program include discrete mathematics, C++ programming, data structures, operating systems, and networking

<h2>Laboratory Engineer: NYU Center for Neural Science</h2>
<p>
    I worked with postdoctoral researchers to design and build virtual reality experiments. Here I physically constructed
    virtual reality training rooms and edited software for the virtual environment display. I was additionally
    responsible for rapid prototyping of needed parts and repairs, and general lab maintenance.

<h2>Product Design Engineer: Cornell Engineering</h2>
<p>
    At Cornell I created a portable document camera to address difficulties with Zoom screen sharing (a problem during
    the COVID-19 remote learning era), and designed social distancing dividers to help businesses and public spaces
    reopen safely. I conducted a choice-based conjoint analysis to find the most preferred attributes for these
    products, and identified structural weak points using Finite Element Analysis with ANSYS.
</p>
<h2>Laboratory Assistant: Cornell Fluid Mechanics Lab</h2>
<p>
    Here I assisted Professors and PhD students studying aerodynamics. I partially constructed and maintained a
    circular testing apparatus to help test the affects of turbulence when subjected to rapidly changing pressures.
</p>
<h2>Teaching Assistant: Cornell Physics Department</h2>
<p>
    I taught classes of up to 20 students in introductory-level physics courses, such as Heat & Mechanics and
    Electricity & Magnetism. I also taught physics for life-sciences students, adapting complex topics to be more
    understandable for students who had no prior physics background. In addition, I lead laboratory experiments with
    students, assisted with any problems or equipment troubleshooting, and trained students to use standard physics
    laboratory equipment.

<h2>Consulting Engineer Intern: Robert Derector Associates</h2>
<p>
    At RDA I designed and edited HVAC duct systems using Autodesk AutoCAD and Revit. I worked on approximately 6
    projects per week and assisted in data collection for on-site inspections.

<h2>Lifeguard: Rolling Hills Condominiums, Brookshire Condominiums, Newburgh YWCA</h2>
<p>
    I worked for several years as a lifeguard for various pool locations across the Hudson Valley area. In these
    positions I performed standard lifeguard tasks such as watching over pool patrons, maintaining pool deck
    cleanliness, and ensuring that safety equipment is up-to-date.

<h2>Swimming Instructor: Washingtonville Seahawks</h2>
<p>
    I instructed elementary school aged children in different swimming techniques; either strokes or beginner water
    techniques like floating/treading water, depending on their competency.
